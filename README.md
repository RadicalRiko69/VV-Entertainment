### BEFORE YOU PLAY:
Only 9:16 has been tested, other ratios may not work as intended.

### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Your computer ***must be in portrait mode*** for this to work! Landscape is not supported, this theme is designed to be like a phone. Make sure you change your graphics settings on SM5/OutFox before switching to the theme, otherwise you may have trouble reading certain settings in landscape if you switch to the VV Ent theme without reading this first.

2. Once your graphics settings and orientation are set up correctly, switch to the theme and go into the Scripts folder of the theme. Open `09 Categories.lua` with Code and find the `RIO_FOLDER_NAMES` section, edit the names in the quotes to the folders you want to appear with the selected character.

3. Hold Ctrl and press F2 to reload the scripts, then you're ready to go! You may also reboot your game if this is easier. Enjoy the mobile phone theme!
